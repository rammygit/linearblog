				</header>
				<p>MDFW Gujarati Samaj was founded in 1990. The goal of DFW Gujarati Samaj was to unite all Gujarati people under one roof and to promote and preserve our culture, heritage, language, social and cultural awareness and respect of Gujarat, India by providing a platform to Gujarati community while serving the community needs. </p>
 
<p>The activities developed steadily through the past 20+ years and have culminated in a strong and vibrant Gujarati cultural organization. The foundation of our Samaj is strong due to the hard work and dedication of our past and present Executive Committee and Board of Trustee leaders, volunteers, as well as the ongoing support from our Gujarati community. The commitment of its strong cohesive membership has never looked back. </p>
 
<p>Gujarati Samaj has served a number of activities and services to communities and youth organizations, cultural activities such as: Garba, Raas, Gujarati drama, lok sangeet, Ponk Party and festival celebration such as, Uttryan, Holi, Navratri</p>
 
<p>Today, our goal remains to increase our membership, invest in the next generation--our youth, and to build a central location for Samaj to provide resources to our community……from our children to our senior citizens.</p>
 
<p>As we enter into the new century, we want to lead Gujarati Samaj to new technology by providing Internet edge, allowing our youth to participate with excitement and enthusiasm, who will proudly continue to carry our heritage.</p>
 
<p>With the help of every Gujarati member, our goals and dreams can be reality. We encourage each and every Gujarati family to participate in Gujarati Samaj by becoming a member and participate in its activities and help us grow.</p>
