					<h2>About Gujarati Samaj</h2>
					<span class="byline">A Platform for Gujarati Community</span>
				</header>
				<p>GSGL (Gujarati Samaj of Greater Louisville) was founded in 1990. GSGL was formed to bring together all Louisville and near by cities Gujarati people to promote and preserve Gujarati culture, heritage, language, social and cultural awareness by providing a platform to socialize and network within community while serving the community needs.</p>
 
<p>Gujarati Samaj each year performs events like: Navratri Garbas, Gujarati drama(s), Picnics, and festival celebration such as Holi, etc.</p>
 
<p>We plan to increase membership, invest in the next generation--our youth, and to build a central location for Samaj to provide resources to our community……from our children to our senior citizens.  
As we enter into the new century, we want to lead Gujarati Samaj to new technology by providing Internet edge, allowing our youth to participate with excitement and enthusiasm, who will proudly continue to carry our heritage.</p>
 
<p>With the help of every Gujarati member, our goals and dreams can be reality. We encourage each and every Gujarati family to participate in Gujarati Samaj by becoming a member and participate in its activities and help us grow.</p>
